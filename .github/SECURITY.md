# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This library may contain a code, that could be crucial and very sensitive for secure environments. 
We need to ensure this toolkit won't cause trouble when being used in production builds.

To simplify version management, we only support the latest version of the library and do not provide security backports for
older builds. We always try to make sure our library doesn't break compatibility with 
older versions often (or with more significant changes), therefore it's important to keep the library up-to-date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you feel like you've found a security issue within the library, you should draft an advisory, so we can 
discuss the situation and possible fixes at: [advisory page](https://github.com/zpl-c/track/security/advisories)
